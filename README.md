This Python script employs the Turtle graphics library to visually represent a randomly generated rectangle and a user-specified point on a 2D canvas. 
The code defines classes for Points and Rectangles, enhancing them with graphical capabilities. Users input a guessed point, and the script determines if it falls within the generated rectangle. 
The Turtle graphics display showcases both the random rectangle and the user's point, providing an interactive visual representation.
